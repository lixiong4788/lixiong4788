- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lixiong4788
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the third-party build
 why we can't find the file(like /tmp/tritonbuild/tritonserver/build/third-party/libevent/include/evhttp.h) in the local system.
 the /tmp don't contain anything about the tritonbuild ,how can we do that?
 Is there a way to cache the git files of third-party librariesï¼Ÿ
 China's network is not good, it is often easy to interrupt and cause compilation failure.
